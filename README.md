# Embeddings-of-wild-coloured-surfaces

## TODOs

- intersection testing
- Common vertex testing 
- apply theory to icosaehdron etc.
- Smallest tetra torus without intersection
- For a fixed h, check how many solutions of 'a' exist. Using: 1. Coeffs in b and poly in a and taking out leading coeffs.
-                                                              2. Looking at discriminant.
- Complete Octahedra mmr structure.
